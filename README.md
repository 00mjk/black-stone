BLACK-STONE
===========

Specification and Implementation of Quantum Common Lisp, for gate-model quantum computers.

Note: due to an unfortunate naming conflict with Omer's QCL, a quantum programming language based on the syntax of C, we will refer to Quantum Common Lisp as (qcÎ»), or qclambda in the source.

Based on:

* [Quipper, embedded, scalable pure functional language for quantum computation](http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/quipper/)
* [Quantum Lambda Calculus](http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/papers/#qlambdabook)
